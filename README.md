## Getting started ##

Node.js with NPM 1.2 or newer is required to build the project. For
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, this can be acquired with
`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js` followed by `sudo apt-get install nodejs`.
If for some reason you want to build and install Node.js from sources see:
https://github.com/HSLdevcom/hsl-navigator/wiki/Building-node-from-sources

After installing Node.js go to the directory where you want to install the City Navigator.
There, run `git clone https://github.com/codeforeurope/navigator-proto.git`. 

In the navigator-proto directory install dependencies with `npm install`.

Install build tool with `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`. Run
`grunt server` and if everything goes well open
http://localhost:9001/ with your web browser.

Or, install build tool with `npm install grunt-cli` and run dev server with
`node_modules/.bin/grunt server`.

If you encounter errors, you may want to run commands `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade` and
`sudo apt-get update` to make sure everything is up-to-date.

## Running tests (on a desktop browser) ##

Install testem with `sudo npm install -g testem coffee-script`.

Run tests with `grunt test`. (This may finish early if you have Firefox 
running already.)

To use Phantomjs instead of Firefox, you can install it with 
`sudo apt-get install phantomjs` and replace `firefox` with `phantomjs` 
in `Gruntfile.coffee`.

## Running tests (on a mobile browser) ##

Tests can be run on mobile browsers at SauceLabs. (Unfortunately, the current
SauceLabs integration for testem is mostly just a hack and that's why
the current experience is quite poor.)

Install saucelauncher from source with `sudo npm install -g
git://github.com/datakurre/saucelauncher.git`.
(Once https://github.com/airportyh/saucelauncher/pull/3 has been merged and
released, you may switch back to a released version of saucelauncher.)

Add `~/.saucelabs.json` in a format:

```json
{
    "username": "mysaucelabsuserid",
    "api_key": "mysecretsaucelabsapikey"
}
```

Run tests with `grunt test-mobile`.

## Writing tests ##

Run `grunt test` at least once before (to generate working `testem.json`).

Start watching test environment with `testem`.

Follow instructions on screen to register browser with testem.

Edit test below `./tests`. Tests are run when changes in test suites are
detected.

## Running Robot Framework tests ##

Run ``python bootstrap.py --version 2.1.1`` and ``bin/buildout``.

Run ``grunt test-robot``.

## Using icons

Add svg file(s) under folder `./static/images`.  Run `grunt icon` to generate png files.

In code, use `citynavicon.get_icon_path("myicon")` to get path to image that you can, for example use as src attribute in an img html element. Alternatively you can use `citynavicon.get_icon_html(name)` function to get an img element that has attributes style="height: 20px" and class="ui-li-icon". Finally, in the index.html you can include images via defining img element with id="citynavicon-myicon" where "citynavicon-" is mandatory part and "myicon" specifies name of the image.

Note that svg files should define svg as default namespace for grunticon to work at the moment. Also note that svg files should define viewBox="0 0 w h" attribute where w and h correspond the defined width and height attribute values. The viewBox attribute ensures better browser compatability.
